# Banking Example

We have both the [Production code](https://github.com/mirsaeedi/SoftwareTestingTurorials/blob/dependency_injection/src/main/java/tutorial/core/banking/services/CoreService.java) and [Test code](https://github.com/mirsaeedi/SoftwareTestingTurorials/blob/dependency_injection/src/test/java/tutoria/core/banking/transfer/test/TestTransferScenarios.java) in this branch. 

In this tutorial you learn how to delegate the responsibily of object creation to a Dependency Injector like Google Guice. You'll also learn about Dependency Inversion Principle or DIP.

You can find the task list inside the [Startup.java](https://github.com/mirsaeedi/SoftwareTestingTurorials/blob/dependency_injection/src/main/java/Startup.java)

The Slide Deck is uploaded [here](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AvPG99HJpJYfhppsc0C2PYjS6zjipA).
