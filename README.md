# Banking Example

We have both the [Production coded](https://github.com/mirsaeedi/SoftwareTestingTurorials/blob/junit_introduction/src/main/java/tutorial/core/banking/services/CoreService.java) and [Test codes](https://github.com/mirsaeedi/SoftwareTestingTurorials/blob/junit_introduction/src/test/java/tutoria/core/banking/transfer/test/TestTransferScenarios.java) in this branch. 

Our developer was failed to implement the requirements as they are defined and asked. 

Since, we have unit tests we are able to find out that the system does not act in a correcy way and there are inconsistencies between the system and requirements. So, your task here is to locate and fix the bugs by getting help from the available unit tests.

At the end you also to implement a [new test](https://github.com/mirsaeedi/SoftwareTestingTurorials/blob/515980e7f25c62d4fa10a9811b47aee66f3c3c4c/src/test/java/tutoria/core/banking/transfer/test/TestTransferScenarios.java#L263).
