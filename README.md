# Banking Example

We have both the [Production code](https://github.com/mirsaeedi/SoftwareTestingTurorials/blob/git_bisect/src/main/java/tutorial/core/banking/services/CoreService.java) and [Test code](https://github.com/mirsaeedi/SoftwareTestingTurorials/blob/git_bisect/src/test/java/tutoria/core/banking/transfer/test/TestTransferScenarios.java) in this branch. 

In this tutorial you learn how to make the code testable and how to isolate the code from its external dependencies and their unwanted consequences.
