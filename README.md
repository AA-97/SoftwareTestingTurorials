# Banking Example

We have both the [Production code](https://github.com/mirsaeedi/SoftwareTestingTurorials/blob/Mockito/src/main/java/tutorial/core/banking/services/CoreService.java) and [Test code](https://github.com/mirsaeedi/SoftwareTestingTurorials/blob/Mockito/src/test/java/tutoria/core/banking/transfer/test/TestTransferScenarios.java) in this branch. 

In this tutorial you learn how to make the code testable and how to isolate the code from its external dependencies and their unwanted consequences.

The Slide Deck is uploaded [here](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AvPG99HJpJYfhppsc0C2PYjS6zjipA).
