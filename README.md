# Banking Example

We have both the [Production code](https://github.com/mirsaeedi/SoftwareTestingTurorials/blob/junit_introduction/src/main/java/tutorial/core/banking/services/CoreService.java) and [Test code](https://github.com/mirsaeedi/SoftwareTestingTurorials/blob/junit_introduction/src/test/java/tutoria/core/banking/transfer/test/TestTransferScenarios.java) in this branch. 

Our developer has failed to implement the requirements as they are defined and asked. 

Since we have unit tests we are able to find out that the system does not act in a correct way and there are inconsistencies between the system and its requirements. So, your task here is to locate and fix the bugs by getting help from the available unit tests.

At the end you also need to implement a [new test](https://github.com/mirsaeedi/SoftwareTestingTurorials/blob/515980e7f25c62d4fa10a9811b47aee66f3c3c4c/src/test/java/tutoria/core/banking/transfer/test/TestTransferScenarios.java#L263).
